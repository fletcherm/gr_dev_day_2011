This repository is a [ShowOff](https://github.com/schacon/showoff) project for the talk I gave at the GR DevDay conference in November 2011.

[JRuby, Rails, and Torquebox](http://fletcherm.github.com/gr_dev_day_2011/#1)

If you weren't at the talk, then the slideshow may not make much sense. Too bad for you.
